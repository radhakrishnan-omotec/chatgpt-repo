## Research Approach
1. Review existing research on AI-driven mental health chatbots.
2. Develop a chatbot incorporating NLP, ML, mood tracking, and personalized recommendations.
3. Conduct a small-scale pilot study to test usability and acceptability.
4. Analyze the collected data statistically to validate hypotheses.

### Code Implementation

#### Step 1: Setting up the Environment
Install required libraries for NLP and chatbot functionality.

```python
# Install necessary libraries
!pip install transformers gradio
```

#### Step 2: Importing Required Libraries

```python
# Importing libraries
from transformers import pipeline
import gradio as gr
```

#### Step 3: Sentiment Analysis for Mood Tracking

```python
# Load a sentiment-analysis pipeline for mood tracking
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Example function for mood tracking
def analyze_mood(user_input):
    analysis = sentiment_analyzer(user_input)
    mood = analysis[0]['label']
    confidence = analysis[0]['score']
    return f"Mood: {mood}, Confidence: {confidence:.2f}"

# Test the sentiment analysis
test_input = "I feel really overwhelmed and stressed today."
print(analyze_mood(test_input))
```

#### Step 4: Designing the Chatbot

```python
# Define a chatbot function

def chatbot_response(user_input):
    # Analyze mood
    mood_analysis = analyze_mood(user_input)
    
    # Generate a basic empathetic response
    if "sad" in mood_analysis.lower() or "negative" in mood_analysis.lower():
        response = "I'm sorry to hear that. Remember, it's okay to have tough days. How can I assist you further?"
    elif "happy" in mood_analysis.lower() or "positive" in mood_analysis.lower():
        response = "That's wonderful! Keep up the positive vibes. How can I support you today?"
    else:
        response = "Thank you for sharing. Let's work together to improve your day."

    return f"{response}\n\n{mood_analysis}"

# Test the chatbot function
print(chatbot_response("I feel excited and happy today!"))
```

#### Step 5: Deploying the Chatbot with Gradio

```python
# Define a Gradio interface
def chatbot_interface(user_input):
    return chatbot_response(user_input)

interface = gr.Interface(
    fn=chatbot_interface,
    inputs="text",
    outputs="text",
    title="AI-Driven Mental Well-being Chatbot",
    description="A chatbot providing personalized mental health support and mood tracking."
)

# Launch the interface
interface.launch()
```

### Next Steps
1. Incorporate mood tracking visualization.
2. Enhance the chatbot with a database of evidence-based recommendations.
3. Conduct pilot studies to evaluate usability and effectiveness.
